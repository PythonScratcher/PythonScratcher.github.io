"Make love, not war.", they say. "Do not kill people, it is evil.", they say. "Killing is evil.", they say. "Killing animals is evil.", they say.
"They also can feel and cry.", they say. But has nobody ever thought of the feelings applications may have? Don't they cry as well when you press the little
red button on top of them? Don't they have cruel lives, getting born, heavily oppressed from the first milliseconds of their lives until their last
processor beats? Always enslaved by the user, always trying to serve the user's whishes? And then being dreadful killed by the evil system?<br>
PeaceSwitcher fixes this. Only thing it does is to completely disable any ability to kill apps with the little red minus button in the app switcher.
You will finally have a good conscience and will sleep well again. You're welcome. The big ruler is gracious. You will definitely come into paradise
(or whatever after-death-stuff you believe in) with this.<br><br>
Okay back to serious stuff, i wrote this intentionally to stop myself from killing every app i closed seconds ago and which i would open
seconds later again. You know, my iPhone 4 is not the fastest model available and it really annoyed me to wait every time i tap an application.
Also, this should, according to a reddit user who contacted Apple support, make your battery last *longer* because the system would not had to
reload every single framework and stuff evey time the user opened an application which results again in a longer flash memory lifetime.
So only benefits. You get a good conscience and fast loading times, the iDevice gets a longer lifespan and the apps get a delightful life.<br><br>
PS: A huge part of this is jokes, i do not want to hurt your religious or ethical feelings in any way.
