Requires iOS 6 (I think :P)<br><br>
Requested by twitter user @7bubbl3s (or reddit user /u/7bubbl3s or github user 7bubbl3s) to get the old (iOS 1-5?) lockscreen lock back. Unfortunately, I will not have the ability to maintain this, if it does not work for you, make it better, source code below. Also, be warned: This is neither tested very well nor implemented well, try it out yourself! I initially did not even want to make this available on my repo, but I consider it "stable" enough now that I fixed a bunch of bugs.<br><br>
