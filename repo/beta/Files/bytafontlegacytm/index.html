Requires iOS 6 (i think :P)<br><br>
A Tweak Mode for old iOS versions which are not supported by BytaFont2 and BytaFontTM (aka BytaFont Tweak Mode). You will not need any of BytaFont, BytaFont2, or BytaFontTM installed in order to use this. I managed to do some "control" magic to satisfy Cydia (dpkg) with the dependencies and let you install Fonts for Tweak Mode without even having installed it ;P.<br><br>
There is much room for improvements here, you could, for example, hook even deeper into iOS and replace fonts in CoreGraphics framework. This would also resolve version incompatibilities...<br><br>
I think font theming is a quite cool thing but the problem i had with it was that BytaFont (the only big font provider) REPLACED SYSTEM FILES. I personally do not like it when things replace anthing so i never themed my fonts. Then i saw BytaFont Tweak Mode coming up in Cydia which only supported BytaFont2 and so only iOS 7+. I only have an iPhone 4 with iOS 6 atm so i could, again, not theme my fonts :(. Because iOS 6 is quite ancient for now, i knew that the BytaBont team would never release a tweak mode for BytaFont 1. So i just wrote it myself within a week or two (i am really sloow :D) and it does its job quite well and seamless. If you think this should come up in Cydia store, please organize some testing devices for me so we can test BFLTM very well first (as mentioned above the hooks i use are quite unstable regarding different iOS versions...) or you just wait until i am motivated enough to implement a stable soultion by myself (which maybe never happens, because it is 100% stable for me). Also the demand, it think, is much too small to release on Cydia.<br><br>
I published this because it is my first MS-hook tweak and it shows quite good how to hook deeper into iOS with MobileSubstrate than Logos could ever do. So if you learned cool things from this, say "Thank you" to me: henry.anonym@gmail.com :)<br><br>
