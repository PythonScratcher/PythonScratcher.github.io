Crossfade. In your Music app. Native.<br><br>
Well, nearly native. Crossfade breaks lots of things. Album art covers. Maybe even remotes. Crossfade has bugs. Ugly fades. Crashes.<br>
Crossfade is provided without any warranty.<br>
BUT: Crossfade is open source. Modify it. Extend it. Do it better.
Disable in the music preference panel. No screenshots for this product.<br><br>
