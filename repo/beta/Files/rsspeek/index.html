Requires iOS 6, might work on 5, 7, 8, 9 as well...<br><br>
(Notice: This is still public "testing" phase. It works very reliable, but if you find a problem, it is not an intended feature. Email me please!)<br>
An RSS client which does not suck. In your notification center, waiting to serve you!
I desigend RSSPeek to integrate as unobstrusive as possible into the "stock" iOS operating system.
A second design primitive was a good performance in both time and reliability of serving fast and recent content to the user.
<br>
<br>
Known issues as of 1.0-rc1-1 (sorry ._. ):<br>
- Preference app crashes when coming back after leaving the RSSPeek panel open (No idea why...).<br>
- RSSPeek shows "offline" although a default RSS feed (Apple PR) should be loaded.<br>
- When adding the widget to NC in Settings, there is neither a name nor an icon visible (WeeLoader bug).<br>
