Requires iOS 6 (maybe compatible below)<br><br>
A very basic app downgrade tool implementation. I wrote this because I could not wait for unlimapps to update their App Admin tool for iOS 6 (which might never happen, anyways...). As I said, just the very basics: Downgrade an app if you have a workig "external version identifier". Not hiding updates, no fancy UI, complicated interface.<br>
<b>Notice:</b> As of V.0.2, there is no preference panel anymore. Adowngrader will prompt you with a text input where you are allowed to change the downloading app identifier.<br><br>
<b>How to use</b><br>
1) Find out the "external version identifier" of the version of the app you want to downgrade.<br>
2) Download your app as usual (one at a time).<br>
3) Paste your external version identifier into the text prompt (Adowngrader might prompt you more than once).<br>
4) Important: *Wait* for the download to finish!<br>
5) Start your app :)<br><br>
<b>Spelling</b><br>
"A" like the french "un" (one/a) and "downgrader" like the english word "downgrade" with an appended "-er", like in "murderer". Short "A" and stress the "do", then "wngrader" spoken out slowly. I have no idea why I spent one thought on this.<br>
