Requires iOS 6 (definitely!)<br><br>
I was tired of pressing the home-button of my poorly-old iPhone 4 so i wrote this. Just swipe up to reveal the app switcher (multitasking bar) and swipe down to close. This also works for landscape mode, swipe left/right then. This may contain bugs and incompatibility, if you find any, send me an email and i will fix it asap :)<br><br>
